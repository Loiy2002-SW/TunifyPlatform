## Overview of Relationships

The Tunify platform's database is designed with several entities to efficiently manage and store information related to users, subscriptions, playlists, songs, albums, and artists. Below is an overview of the relationships between these entities:

1. **Users and Subscriptions**
   - **Users** are linked to **Subscriptions** through a foreign key relationship. Each user has a `SubscriptionId` that references the `Id` of a subscription plan. This relationship ensures that each user is associated with a specific subscription type, which defines their access level and features on the platform.
   - **One-to-Many Relationship**: One subscription can have multiple users, but each user can only have one subscription.

2. **Users and Playlists**
   - **Users** can create multiple **Playlists**. Each playlist is linked to a user through a foreign key (`UserId`).
   - **One-to-Many Relationship**: One user can have multiple playlists, but each playlist is associated with one user.

3. **Playlists and Songs**
   - The relationship between **Playlists** and **Songs** is managed through a join table called `PlaylistSongs`. This table contains the foreign keys for both playlists and songs, allowing a many-to-many relationship.
   - **Many-to-Many Relationship**: One playlist can contain multiple songs, and one song can appear in multiple playlists.

4. **Songs and Albums**
   - Each **Song** belongs to an **Album**. The `AlbumId` in the Songs table references the `Id` in the Albums table.
   - **One-to-Many Relationship**: One album can have multiple songs, but each song belongs to one album.

5. **Songs and Artists**
   - Each **Song** is created by an **Artist**. The `ArtistId` in the Songs table references the `Id` in the Artists table.
   - **One-to-Many Relationship**: One artist can create multiple songs, but each song is created by one artist.
